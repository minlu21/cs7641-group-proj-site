## Methods

> Present proposed solutions including specific data processing methods and machine learning algorithms, and elaborate on why you think each will be effective. It is recommended to identify specific functions/classes in existing packages and libraries (i.e. scikit-learn) rather than coding the algorithms from scratch.
